    <h1>Maggie de Poortere's Biography</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Maggie de Poortere and I am a senior studying Advertising. I really enjoy the aspects of design and art direction that go into advertising. My courses and past work experience have allowed me to develop my design techniques and skills. I frequently use <strong>Adobe Creative Cloud</strong> to create and edit projects for class and my freelance job. Learning new shortcuts and techniques on the software keeps the work exciting.

    <h2>Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
        Outside of school, I like to spend my free time painting or hanging out with friends. Most people would say I talk too much about my bulldogs, I agree, but I don’t see that changing anytime soon.

    <p>
        Like so many of the students here, I am from New Jersey. However, I do not participate in any Jersey rivalries regarding breakfast meat or geographical boundaries. If I had plans for life after I graduate I would include them here, but I’m indecisive and we are still in a pandemic so I’ll hold off for now. One thing I know for sure is I would like to travel and explore new places and maybe even live abroad.
